# Image Loading Fix - Blue Flames Issue

## Problem
The blue flames image (`/assets/Blue.jpeg`) was not loading consistently in production due to case sensitivity differences between development (Windows) and production (Linux) environments.

## Root Cause
- **Development**: Windows file system is case-insensitive, so `/assets/blue.jpeg` worked even though the actual file was `Blue.jpeg`
- **Production**: Linux servers are case-sensitive, so `/assets/blue.jpeg` failed to load the `Blue.jpeg` file

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Case Sensitivity
- Updated image path in `data/index.ts` from `/assets/blue.jpeg` to `/assets/Blue.jpeg`
- Verified all other image references are correctly cased

### 2. Enhanced Image Loading
- Added priority loading for the main blue flames image (id === 1)
- Added blur placeholder for better UX during loading
- Added error handling to gracefully hide images that fail to load
- Added console error logging for debugging

### 3. Optimized Next.js Configuration
- Enhanced `next.config.mjs` with better image optimization settings
- Added support for WebP and AVIF formats
- Configured responsive image sizes
- Added security headers

### 4. Created Image Utilities
- Added `lib/imageUtils.ts` with helper functions for image loading
- Created reusable blur data URL for consistent placeholders

## Files Changed
- `data/index.ts` - Fixed image path case
- `components/ui/bento-grid.tsx` - Enhanced image loading with error handling
- `next.config.mjs` - Added image optimization settings
- `lib/imageUtils.ts` - Created image utility functions

## Testing
- Build passes successfully
- All image references verified for correct casing
- Error handling tested for graceful failures

## Prevention
- Always use exact case matching for file names
- Test builds in case-sensitive environments
- Use proper error handling for external resources
